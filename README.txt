# Applied Robotics Technologies Project

This repository contains the development and implementation of a software project focused on the analysis and simulation of a 4 Degrees of Freedom (4DOF) robotic system.

## Project Objectives

1. **Kinematics and Dynamics Analysis**:

   - Study and simulate the robotic arm's movement, including working volume, joint space, and center of mass.
   - Derive and use the Jacobian matrix for motion control.

2. **Robotic Tasks**:

   - Design and implement a palletizing task with user-defined positions.
   - Develop path planning algorithms using lines and parabolas to optimize motion time.

3. **Simulations**:

   - **MATLAB**: Simulate joint space, velocity, acceleration, and torque.
   - **Simulink**: Build and validate dynamic models of the robot.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Users can specify link lengths, weights, motor parameters, and transmission details.
- **Dynamic Path Planning**: Adjusts trajectories based on user-defined positions for Home, Pick, and Place locations.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers kinematics, dynamics, and task-specific simulations.

## Technology Stack

- MATLAB & Simulink for simulations and analysis.
